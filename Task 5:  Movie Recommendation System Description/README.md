# Movie Recommendation System Description

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering techniques. The system analyzes user ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations. The project is built in a Jupyter Notebook environment and uses the classic **MovieLens 100K dataset** for demonstration.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **MovieLens 100K** dataset, which includes:

- **100,000 ratings** from 943 users on 1,682 movies
- **Ratings file**: `u.data` (user_id, movie_id, rating, timestamp)
- **Movies file**: `u.item` (movie_id, title, release_date, video_release_date, IMDb URL)

### Data Preprocessing

- Loaded and merged ratings and movie metadata
- Handled missing values in the movies dataset (e.g., `video_release_date` and `imdb_url` contain nulls)
- Explored basic statistics and data structure

## Features

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes rating distributions, user activity, and movie popularity
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interaction data to generate recommendations
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates recommendation quality using metrics like RMSE or precision/recall

## Installation & Setup

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy (for sparse matrices)

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

## Usage

1. Download the MovieLens 100K dataset (or use the provided code to load it directly)
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `Movie_Recommendation_System_Description.ipynb`
3. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform EDA
   - Build and train the recommendation model
   - Generate recommendations for users

## Methods

- **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-user or item-item similarity
- **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages matrix factorization techniques (e.g., SVD)
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combines multiple methods for improved accuracy

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations and metrics to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system. Example outputs include:

- Rating distribution charts
- User-movie interaction heatmaps
- Top-N recommended movies for a sample user

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate content-based filtering (using movie genres, descriptions, etc.)
- Implement deep learning-based recommenders (e.g., neural collaborative filtering)
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
