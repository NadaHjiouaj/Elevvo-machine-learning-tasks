## 📊 Student Score Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting student exam scores using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook performs comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and modeling using a dataset containing various features related to student performance.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates student exam scores based on factors such as study hours, attendance, sleep patterns, parental involvement, and other socio-academic variables.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This project was developed in **Google Colab**, leveraging its cloud-based computational resources for efficient data processing and machine learning model training. The use of Colab provided access to GPU acceleration and seamless integration with Google Drive for data storage.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`student_performance.csv`) contains **6607 rows and 20 columns**, including both numerical and categorical features such as:

- `Hours_Studied`
- `Attendance`
- `Sleep_Hours`
- `Previous_Scores`
- `Parental_Involvement`
- `Motivation_Level`
- `Internet_Access`
- `Exam_Score` (target variable)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based development environment

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Descriptive Statistics & Data Overview**
3. **Missing Value Handling**
4. **Data Type Analysis**
5. **Data Visualization**
6. **Feature Engineering**
7. **Model Training & Evaluation**
8. **Results & Interpretation**

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Other regression models** (as applicable)

## 📊 Results

The model performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🚀 How to Run in Google Colab

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset `student_performance.csv` when prompted
3. Run the cells sequentially (Runtime → Run all)
4. If no file is uploaded, a sample dataset will be generated automatically

## 💡 Key Features of the Colab Implementation

- Interactive data exploration
- Automated missing value handling
- Dynamic visualization capabilities
- GPU acceleration support
- Cloud-based execution without local setup requirements
